### About Me

> 
Hey all, I am currently pursuing my second year of B.Tech. in computer science. I am so passionate about learning new knowledge every day, and like someone said, every day is a school day.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Currently holding position as Associate VP of Division H in Toastmasters and have also been an active member, hence i am able to command and interact with a team very well.
- I have organized CTF's and various other events during Shreshta, one of the most prestigious tech fests in the state.
- I have been assigned the role cybersecurity mentor in my college, hence it is my duty to lead the cybersecurity prospects in my college in their career.

#### Networking: 

- Being a part of many projects, i know how important a team is to getting your goals checked off, I try my best to put myself out there and get to connect with as many people as i can.
- I will try to connect to as many people I can find, not only within my doman, but also outside of mine so that we do not simply amplify our strengths, rather cover each others weaknesses as I believe that that is what makes a good team.
- I will, if given a spot in the top 100 try to bring as many of the peoplw I met and acquainted with, back onto a project that I am assigned as I respect them as professionals and would love to see what they can bring to the table.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As a student who envisions to reach the peak of cybersecurity or at least leave a lasting impression on it, I have never been in a professional environment wherein I could apply my skills to their best. I expect being a part of top 100 will give me an opportunity to show the world what I can do in my realm, if given a chance.
- Like I mentioned before, I am very keen on the fact that I would like to give back to the very society that nurtured me. That being said, I would not like to forget my roots, and hence take up one, if not many of the tasks or innovations and implement them in the best fashion possible.

#### Career Plan: 

- My immediate plans are to get into Cybersecurity or AI & DS and then from there expand my knowledge as required. I would not like to limit myself to a particular field, nor would I like to be a Jack of all trades. Hence I picked these two domains to remain committed to, both in the short term, as well as the long term and leave a lasting impact or a relatable vision that the future leaders of my country can pick up on.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has many, if not the best talent in the whole country. Furthermore, there are many government initiatives as well that support and try to nurture this talent. My thoughts are that many of these initiatives remain hidden and far from reach of many people as they arent aware of it, hence they go for the cliche "abroad, make money situation". We must provide as well as spread awareness as to what their opportunities are so that we manage to retain all, if not most of the talent that we so carefully bring up in our state.
